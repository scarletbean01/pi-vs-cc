## API Keys

Pi does **not** auto-load `.env` files — API keys must be present in your shell's environment **before** you launch Pi. A sample file is provided:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env   # copy the template
# open .env and fill in your keys
```

`.env.sample` covers the four most popular providers:

| Provider         | Variable             | Get your key                                                                                               |

### Sourcing your keys

Pick whichever approach fits your workflow:

**Option A — Source manually each session:**
```bash
source .env && pi
```

**Option B — One-liner alias (add to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`):**
```bash
alias pi='source $(pwd)/.env && pi'
```

**Option C — Use the `just` task runner (auto-wired via `set dotenv-load`):**
```bash
just pi           # .env is loaded automatically for every just recipe
just ext-minimal  # works for all recipes, not just `pi`
```

## Installation

```bash
bun install
```

## Usage

### Run a single extension

```bash
pi -e extensions/<name>.ts
```

### Stack multiple extensions

Extensions compose — pass multiple `-e` flags:

```bash
pi -e extensions/minimal.ts -e extensions/cross-agent.ts
```

### Use `just` recipes

`just` wraps the most useful combinations. Run `just` with no arguments to list all available recipes:

```bash
just
```

Common recipes:

```bash
just pi                     # Plain Pi, no extensions
just ext-pure-focus         # Distraction-free mode
just ext-minimal            # Minimal context meter footer
just ext-cross-agent        # Cross-agent command loading + minimal footer
just ext-purpose-gate       # Purpose gate + minimal footer
just ext-tool-counter       # Rich two-line footer with tool tally
just ext-tool-counter-widget # Per-tool widget above the editor
just ext-subagent-widget    # Subagent spawner with live progress widgets
just ext-tilldone           # Task discipline system with live progress tracking
just ext-agent-team         # Multi-agent orchestration grid dashboard (with tool-counter-widget)
just ext-system-select      # Agent persona switcher via /system, --agent, or Ctrl+S shortcuts
just ext-damage-control     # Safety auditing + minimal footer
just ext-damage-control-continue # Same rules, but blocked turns keep running
just ext-agent-chain        # Sequential pipeline orchestrator with step chaining
just ext-pi-pi              # Meta-agent that builds Pi agents using parallel experts
just ext-session-replay     # Scrollable timeline overlay of session history
just ext-theme-cycler       # Theme cycler + minimal footer
just ext-boot              # Dispatcher + system-select + minimal + theme-cycler + coms (herdr-native bootstrap)
just all                    # Open every extension in its own terminal window

# Pi-to-Pi communication (see section below)
just local-coms             # Same-machine peer-to-peer over Unix sockets
just coms-net-server        # Start a local coms-net HTTP/SSE hub (127.0.0.1)
just coms-net-server-lan    # Start a LAN-visible hub (requires PI_COMS_NET_AUTH_TOKEN)
just coms                   # Pi client for the coms-net hub
just coms1                  # …same, pinned to gpt-5.5
just coms2                  # …same, pinned to claude-opus-4-7
```

The `open` recipe allows you to spin up a new terminal window with any combination of stacked extensions (omit `.ts`):

```bash
just open purpose-gate minimal tool-counter-widget
```

## Orchestrating Multi-Agent Workflows

Pi's architecture makes it easy to coordinate multiple autonomous agents. This playground includes several powerful multi-agent extensions:

### Subagent Widget (`/sub`)
The `subagent-widget` extension allows you to offload isolated tasks to background Pi agents while you continue working in the main terminal. Typing `/sub <task>` spawns a headless subagent that reports its streaming progress via a persistent, live-updating UI widget above your editor.

### Agent Teams (`/team`)
The `agent-team` orchestrator operates as a dispatcher. Instead of answering prompts directly, the primary agent reviews your request, selects a specialist from a defined roster, and delegates the work via a `dispatch_agent` tool.
- Teams are configured in `.pi/agents/teams.yaml` where each top-level key is a team name containing a list of agent names (e.g., `frontend: [planner, builder, bowser]`).
- Individual agent personas (e.g., `builder.md`, `reviewer.md`) live in `.pi/agents/`.
- **pi-pi Meta-Agent**: The `pi-pi` team specifically delegates tasks to specialized Pi framework experts (`ext-expert.md`, `theme-expert.md`, `tui-expert.md`) located in `.pi/agents/pi-pi/` to build high-quality Pi extensions using parallel research.
  - **Web Crawling Fallbacks**: To ingest the latest framework documentation dynamically, these experts use `firecrawl` as their default modern page crawler, but are explicitly programmed to safely fall back to the native `curl` baked into their bash toolset if Firecrawl fails or is unavailable.

### Agent Chains (`/chain`)
Unlike the dynamic dispatcher, `agent-chain` acts as a sequential pipeline orchestrator. Workflows are defined in `.pi/agents/agent-chain.yaml` where the output of one agent becomes the input (`$INPUT`) to the next.
- Workflows are defined as a list of `steps`, where each step specifies an `agent` and a `prompt`. 
- The `$INPUT` variable injects the previous step's output (or the user's initial prompt for the first step), and `$ORIGINAL` always contains the user's initial prompt.
- Example: The `plan-build-review` pipeline feeds your prompt to the `planner`, passes the plan to the `builder`, and finally sends the code to the `reviewer`.
- Each step's agent can declare its own model via `model:` frontmatter (see [Per-Agent Model Assignment](#per-agent-model-assignment)).

---

## Herdr-Native Agent Bootstrap

The `bootstrap` extension turns a single **dispatcher** agent into a herdr-native orchestrator. Instead of spawning child `pi` processes in the background, the dispatcher generates a [herdr-spreader](https://github.com/yuk1ty/herdr-spreader) YAML layout, applies it, and every agent comes to life in its own **visible herdr pane** — so you can watch the team work in parallel. Coordination flows over `coms` (peer-to-peer messaging), and the dispatcher aggregates each agent's structured JSON results into a single report.

- **Two topologies:** `chain` (sequential pipeline — each step `coms_await`s its predecessor's output) and `team` (parallel specialists that each `coms_send` results back to the dispatcher).
- **Launch:** run inside a herdr session as the `dispatcher` persona:
  ```bash
  just ext-boot        # equivalent to: pi -e system-select -e minimal -e theme-cycler -e bootstrap -e coms --agent dispatcher
  ```
- **Drive it:** `boot chain <task>`, `boot team <task>`, or `boot auto <task>` (the dispatcher picks the topology).
- **Prerequisites:** `herdr` installed and running (`HERDR_ENV=1`), plus the `herdr-spreader` plugin (or a standalone `herdr-spreader` binary on `PATH`).
- **Agent frontmatter** honors `model:` (per-agent model alias/`provider/id`), `extensions:` (extra `-e` flags per agent), and `color:` (coms identity color).

Results land in `.pi/agent-sessions/<task-id>/report.json` (optionally `report.md`); `boot cleanup <workspace-id>` tears down the herdr workspace and session files.

For the full design, topologies, troubleshooting, and internals, see **[docs/herdr-bootstrap.md](docs/herdr-bootstrap.md)**.

## Per-Agent Model Assignment

By default, every specialist agent spawned by `agent-team`, `agent-chain`, or `pi-pi` inherits the model from the parent Pi session (`ctx.model`) or falls back to a single hardcoded default. **Per-agent model assignment** lets each agent declare its own model in its `.md` frontmatter, so you can run a heavyweight planner on Claude Opus while keeping a lightweight scout on Gemini Flash.

### How it works

Add a `model:` line to any agent definition file in `.pi/agents/`:

```yaml
---
name: planner
description: Architecture and implementation planning
tools: read,grep,find,ls
model: opencode-go/glm-5.1
---
You are a planner agent…
```

The value can be either:

- **A full `provider/id` string** (e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, `opencode-go/minimax-m3`) — passed through as-is to `pi --model`.
- **A short alias** from the `MODEL_ALIASES` map in [`extensions/model-utils.ts`](extensions/model-utils.ts) — e.g. `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`, `flash`, `gemini`, `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-5`.

### Model resolution precedence

The `resolveModel()` function in [`model-utils.ts`](extensions/model-utils.ts) resolves the model at dispatch time with the following precedence:

1. **Agent-declared model** — the `model:` frontmatter value (alias or full string).
2. **Parent session model** — inherited from `ctx.model` if the agent didn't declare one.
3. **Hardcoded fallback** — `openrouter/google/gemini-3-flash-preview`.

If an unknown alias is provided, a warning is logged and the parent/fallback model is used instead.

### Where it's used

| Extension | Field | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **agent-team** | `AgentDef.model` | Dashboard cards show `◆ <model>` or `◆ inherited`; `before_agent_start` catalog includes `**Model:**` line so the dispatcher knows each agent's model |
| **agent-chain** | `AgentDef.model` | Each pipeline step resolves its model independently |
| **pi-pi** | `ExpertDef.model` | Each research expert can use a different model |
| **system-select** | — | Uses `--agent <name>` preselect and model display in the status line |

### Current agent model assignments

The agents in this repo are configured as follows:

| Agent | Model |
| --- | --- |
| `builder` | `opencode-go/minimax-m3` |
| `scout` | `opencode-go/minimax-m3` |
| `planner` | `opencode-go/glm-5.1` |
| `reviewer` | `opencode-go/glm-5.1` |
| `plan-reviewer` | `opencode-go/glm-5.1` |

### Full specification

See [`docs/per-agent-model-assignment.md`](docs/per-agent-model-assignment.md) for the complete design document covering the current architecture, the `resolveModel()` implementation, edge cases, and the porting pattern shared across all four extensions.

## Pi-to-Pi Agent-to-Agent Communication

<div align="center">
  <img src="./images/01-hero.png" alt="Pi to Pi — Two-Way Agent Communication with the Pi Coding Agent" width="700">
</div>

> 📺 **Watch:** [Pi to Pi: Two-Way Agent Orchestration with the Pi Coding Agent](https://youtu.be/PIdETjcXNIk)

What's better than one Pi coding agent? Two. What's better than two isolated side-by-side agents? Two agents that **actually talk to each other**. Subagents, dispatch queues, and agent chains all share one shape: information flows in **one direction** down a hierarchy. `coms` and `coms-net` add the missing pattern — **two equal Pi agents that talk to each other peer-to-peer**, on the same machine or across the network. No orchestrator, no parent/child relationship, no information loss as work travels through layers. The best idea wins, regardless of which agent had it.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./images/08-the-shift.png" alt="The shift: agents as equals, not parent/child — prompt and response both ways" width="700">
</div>

This is the shift. Sub-agent delegation and message queues are powerful patterns, but every one of them moves information in basically one direction. Even when results come back, it's a one-way stream — top-down. Peer-to-peer flips it: prompt → response → prompt → response, between agents who are **equals, not parent and child**. That unlocks bidirectional flows of information by default.

**Why this matters in practice:**
- **Cross-device work.** A production agent on one box, a dev agent on your laptop. The prod side keeps PII redacted while still answering the dev side's questions — real engineering work, no data leak.
- **Heterogeneous teams.** Run `claude-opus-4-7` and `gpt-5.5` and `deepseek` in the same pool. Each model has different RL training; together they catch what either misses alone.
- **Focused context windows.** Each agent stays specialised on its slice instead of one bloated agent juggling every concern. A focused agent is a performant agent — the more unrelated problems you stuff into one context window, the higher your error rate climbs.
- **Flat composition.** It's still just an agent + extension. You can compose this back into an orchestrator pattern when you want top-down, or keep it flat when you don't.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./images/27-flat-org-info-over-titles.png" alt="Hierarchy loses — valuable information over titles and politics — ideas die in hierarchies" width="700">
</div>

The deeper reason this pattern matters: **the best information is almost always on the worker level**, but in a hierarchy it has to climb several layers (and survive several rewrites) before it shapes a decision. Flat structures let valuable information win on its own merit. The same dynamic plays out in agent systems — the agent closest to the artifact (the production database, the running test, the live file) usually has the sharpest view. Letting it speak directly to its peers, rather than routing every signal through an orchestrator, keeps that signal intact.

### Two versions

| | `coms` (local) | `coms-net` (networked) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Transport** | Unix sockets / Windows named pipes | HTTP + Server-Sent Events |
| **Scope** | One machine | Same machine, LAN, or remote URL |
| **Discovery** | File registry at `~/.pi/coms/projects/<project>/agents/*.json` | Shared hub at `~/.pi/coms-net/projects/<project>/server.json` |
| **Server** | None — agents listen directly | `bun scripts/coms-net-server.ts` (Bun HTTP hub) |
| **Tools** | `coms_list`, `coms_send`, `coms_get`, `coms_await` | `coms_net_list`, `coms_net_send`, `coms_net_get`, `coms_net_await` |
| **Widget** | Live pool above the editor | Live pool above the editor |
| **Auth** | OS file perms on `~/.pi/coms/` | `PI_COMS_NET_AUTH_TOKEN` (auto-generated for localhost, required for LAN/remote) |

The entire surface area is four tools. List the agents on the network, send them a prompt, then either poll (non-blocking) or block until the response lands. That's it.

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `*_list` | List peer agents in the pool with names, models, and live context-window usage |
| `*_send` | Send a prompt to a peer; returns a `msg_id` once the receiver acks |
| `*_get` | Non-blocking poll on `msg_id` — `pending` / `complete` / `error` |
| `*_await` | Block until the reply lands or a timeout fires (default 30 min via `PI_COMS_*_TIMEOUT_MS`) |

A reply travels back through the same channel: when an inbound prompt triggers a turn, the receiver's final assistant message is automatically packaged as the response. Sometimes you want fire-and-forget (a Slack-style status ping); sometimes you want to wait for the answer (`*_await`); sometimes you want to keep working and check back later (`*_get`). All three styles fall out of the same four primitives.

### Quick start — same-machine (`coms`)

```bash
# Terminal 1
just local-coms --name planner --purpose "Plans the work" --color "#36F9F6"

# Terminal 2
just local-coms --name coder   --purpose "Writes the code" --color "#FF7EDB"
```

Each agent shows a live pool widget of the others. From either side, the agent can call `coms_send` with `target: "planner"` (or `"coder"`), then `coms_await` for the reply.

### Quick start — networked (`coms-net`)

<div align="center">
  <img src="./images/21-scale-2.png" alt="coms-net — peer-to-peer across devices — planner @laptop and coder @m4 connected via the hub" width="700">
</div>

`coms-net` is the same idea over HTTP/SSE. Now `planner` can live on your laptop and `coder` can live on a Mac Mini, an EU production box, or a remote VM — they meet through a shared hub. The agent on the sensitive side stays on the sensitive side; only the messages cross the wire. Same four tools, just `coms_net_*`-prefixed.

```bash
# Terminal 1 — hub
just coms-net-server                # binds 127.0.0.1, OS-claimed port
# or
just coms-net-server-lan            # binds 0.0.0.0 — requires PI_COMS_NET_AUTH_TOKEN

# Terminal 2 & 3 — clients (auto-discover server.json)
just coms  --name dev
just coms2 --name prod              # …pinned to claude-opus-4-7

# Or different models per seat: coms1=gpt-5.5, coms2=opus-4-7, coms3=deepseek, coms4=glm
just coms1 --name researcher
just coms3 --name verifier
```

For remote / cross-LAN: set `PI_COMS_NET_SERVER_URL` and `PI_COMS_NET_AUTH_TOKEN` in `.env` (template in `.env.sample`). Front the hub with TLS for anything beyond a trusted LAN.

### Safety rails baked in

- **Hop limit** — every prompt envelope carries `hops`; default `MAX_HOPS=5` (`PI_COMS_MAX_HOPS`/`PI_COMS_NET_MAX_HOPS`). Stops runaway A→B→A→B forwarding loops.
- **Audit log** — every send/receive appends to `coms-log` / `coms-net-log` (msg_id, sender, hops only — never prompt bodies).
- **Self-heal** — `coms` probes for stale sockets and prunes dead PIDs on every list; `coms-net` heartbeats every 10s and marks peers `stale`/`offline` on miss.
- **Localhost-by-default** — the hub refuses to bind anything other than `127.0.0.1` unless `PI_COMS_NET_AUTH_TOKEN` is set explicitly.

### Trade-offs (be honest about both sides)

**Pros**
- Bidirectional. Information moves both ways, not down a hierarchy.
- Flat. No "lead agent" — the best information wins on merit, not title.
- Just an agent. Spin one up, kill it, add another — no resume, no spin-up dance.
- Heterogeneous. Mix providers and models in a single conversation pool.

**Cons**
- You build and prompt-engineer the protocol. Sloppy prompts → A→B→A loops.
- Cost scales linearly with agent count plus the bounce factor. Three good agents beats ten noisy ones.
- For some shapes of work an orchestrator is still the right tool. This isn't a replacement for `agent-team` or `agent-chain` — it's a different primitive you compose alongside them.

## Safety Auditing & Damage Control

The `damage-control` extension provides real-time security hooks to prevent catastrophic mistakes when agents execute bash commands or modify files. It uses Pi's `tool_call` event to intercept and evaluate every action against `.pi/damage-control-rules.yaml`.

- **Dangerous Commands**: Uses regex (`bashToolPatterns`) to block destructive commands like `rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`, `aws s3 rm --recursive`, or `DROP DATABASE`. Some rules strictly block execution, while others (`ask: true`) pause execution to prompt you for confirmation.
- **Zero Access Paths**: Prevents the agent from reading or writing sensitive files (e.g., `.env`, `~/.ssh/`, `*.pem`).
- **Read-Only Paths**: Allows reading but blocks modifying system files or lockfiles (`package-lock.json`, `/etc/`).
- **No-Delete Paths**: Allows modifying but prevents deleting critical project configuration (`.git/`, `Dockerfile`, `README.md`).

For a "soft" variant that lets the agent keep working after a block (turn continues with actionable feedback instead of aborting), use [`damage-control-continue`](extensions/damage-control-continue.ts).
